My first Responsive web project.

Created after reading "Responsive Web Design", by Ethan Marcotte.
As a first attempt at RWD, the design was a bit lacking tbh.
However what I learned through this project carried over to the development
of the Eruma San theme which combined a nice but simple design with what I learned here.
